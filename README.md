## About

LostPass is a LastPass native client for iOS. It's not available on the App Store because LastPass requested that I take it down. So I did. Now it's on GitHub.

## Notes

* After cloning don't forget to init the submodules to get cURL and OpenSSL.

* Before building it `cd` into `cURL-SSL-for-iOS` and run `build-libraries.sh`. You might need to modify the iOS SDK version in `cURL-SSL-for-iOS/cURL/build-libcurl.sh` and `cURL-SSL-for-iOS/OpenSSL/build-libssl.sh`.
